# Marketing Analytics Portfolio Project: E-Commerce Performance Deep Dive ðŸ“ˆ

## Overview

This project provides a comprehensive, data-driven analysis of an e-commerce platform's performance, focusing on three core business areas: Conversion Rates, Customer Engagement (Social Media/Content), and Customer Feedback (Reviews).The goal was to pinpoint performance drivers and deliver **actionable recommendations** to optimize marketing strategy, content effectiveness, and overall customer satisfaction.

## Key Performance Metrics Summary

* **Conversion Rate:** The overall conversion rate averaged **8.5%**[cite: 10]. Rates demonstrated strong seasonal swings, including a **18.5% peak in January** (driven by Ski Boots) and a major dip to **4.3% in May**.
* **Customer Engagement (Views):** The platform logged **2,982,369 total views**.Engagement, measured by views, peaked in February and July but showed a concerning **decline from August onwards**.
* **Customer Reviews (Rating):** The average customer rating was a consistent **3.7** throughout the year. While largely positive (high number of 4 and 5-star reviews), this average remains below the internal target of **4.0**.

## Technical Stack

This project was built using a robust data analytics pipeline to handle data preparation, analysis, and visualization:

* **Python (Pandas, NumPy):** Used for **data cleaning, transformation**, and preparatory data analysis, including the processing of large datasets (e.g., analyzing 50,000+ records).
* **SQL:** Leveraged for **efficient data extraction and structuring** of sales, traffic, and social media data from raw database sources.
* **Power BI:** Utilized for **interactive data visualization** and the creation of the final performance dashboard for stakeholder reporting.

## Strategic Actions & Recommendations

### 1. Increase Conversion Rates

* **Target High-Performing Categories:** Focus marketing efforts and inventory on proven high-conversion products such as **Kayaks** and **Ski Boots**.
* **Implement Seasonal Promotions:** Capitalize on the January and September peaks, but more importantly, deploy personalized campaigns during low months like May and October to stabilize conversion funnel performance.

### 2. Enhance Customer Engagement

* **Revitalize Content Strategy:** Address the declining views from August onwards and the continually low interaction rates by experimenting with **more engaging content formats**, such as interactive videos or user-generated content.
* **Optimize Calls-to-Action (CTAs):** Improve low interaction rates by optimizing the placement and messaging of calls-to-action in content, particularly in high-view driving content types like the Blog.

### 3. Improve Customer Feedback Scores

* **Address Mixed and Negative Feedback:** Implement a structured feedback loop to analyze mixed and negative reviews (82 reviews) to identify and address common themes/issues, aiming to move the overall average rating closer to the 4.0 target.
* **Proactive Resolution:** Follow up with customers who left mixed or negative reviews to resolve their issues, encouraging re-rating to convert ambiguous experiences into clearly positive ones.

## Future Scope

The next phase of work involves integrating more predictive and prescriptive analytics:

* **Advanced NLP:** Utilize Natural Language Processing to automate thematic analysis of customer complaints for faster identification of service and product flaws.
* **A/B Testing:** Design and execute controlled experiments on key landing pages during low-conversion periods to validate new optimization strategies.
* **Content ROI:** Establish a system to directly correlate content engagement with sales outcomes to accurately measure the Return on Investment (ROI) for specific marketing content types.ixed or negative reviews to resolve issues and encourage re-rating, aiming to move the average rating closer to the 4.0 target. |
