# Marketing Analytics Portfolio Project: E-Commerce Performance Deep Dive ðŸ“ˆ

## Overview

This project delivers a comprehensive, data-driven analysis of an e-commerce platform's performance across three core areas: **Conversion Rates**, **Customer Engagement** (Social Media/Content), and **Customer Feedback** (Reviews). The goal was to identify key performance drivers, highlight critical drop-off points, and provide **actionable recommendations** to optimize marketing strategy and customer satisfaction.

| **Customer Engagement (Views)** | [cite_start]**2,982,369** Total Views [cite: 6] | [cite_start]Views declined throughout the latter half of the year (August onwards)[cite: 23]. |
| **Customer Reviews (Rating)** | [cite_start]**3.7** Average Rating [cite: 9] | [cite_start]Consistent but fell below the target of **4.0**, suggesting a need for focused improvements[cite: 10]. |

## Key Findings & Strategic Actions

### 1. Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO)

| Finding | Actionable Recommendation |
| :--- | :--- |
| [cite_start]The conversion rate peaked at **18.5% in January** (driven by Ski Boots with 150% conversion) [cite: 19] [cite_start]and reached a low of **4.3% in May**[cite: 16]. | [cite_start]**Implement Seasonal Campaigns:** Focus marketing efforts on high-converting products like Kayaks and Ski Boots during peak months (January and September) and introduce promotions to boost performance in lower-performing months like May[cite: 51, 52]. |
| [cite_start]**Kayaks** (21.4% total) and **Ski Boots** (20.0% total) were the top-converting products overall[cite: 20]. | [cite_start]**Target High-Performing Product Categories:** Allocate disproportionate resources to marketing and inventory management for these proven categories[cite: 51]. |

### 2. Customer Engagement Enhancement

| Finding | Actionable Recommendation |
| :--- | :--- |
| [cite_start]Overall **views declined from August onwards**[cite: 23], indicating reduced audience engagement in the latter half of the year. | [cite_start]**Revitalize Content Strategy:** Experiment with more engaging content formats (e.g., interactive videos, user-generated content) to reverse the decline in views and boost interaction rates[cite: 54]. |
| [cite_start]Clicks and Likes remained low relative to views [cite: 7, 25][cite_start], though the Click-Through Rate (CTR) of engaged users was 15.37%[cite: 7]. | [cite_start]**Optimize Call-to-Action (CTA) Placement:** Boost engagement by optimizing CTA placement in high-performing content types (Blog) and social media, especially during historically lower-engagement months (Septemberâ€“December)[cite: 55]. |

### 3. Customer Feedback Improvement

| Finding | Actionable Recommendation |
| :--- | :--- |
| [cite_start]The average customer rating of **3.7** is stable but below the 4.0 target[cite: 9, 10]. [cite_start]Reviews are dominated by **4-star (140) and 5-star (135) ratings**[cite: 30]. | [cite_start]**Develop Improvement Plans:** Analyze the **82 negative reviews** and the specific concerns found in the **mixed sentiment** categories (Mixed Positive/Negative) to guide tangible product and service improvements[cite: 34, 57]. |
| [cite_start]The presence of mixed sentiments suggests an opportunity to convert ambiguous experiences into clearly positive ones[cite: 36]. | [cite_start]**Proactive Resolution:** Implement a process to follow up directly with customers who left mixed or negative reviews to resolve issues and encourage re-rating, aiming to move the average rating closer to the 4.0 target[cite: 58]. |
